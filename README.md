# RotMG

This repository is to host and share my attempt to make a new client for the game Realm of the Mad God.

It is licenced under the GPLv3.

## Ideas
1. Writed in C11 with minimal dependencies
2. Must be multiplatform (at least Windows and Linux)
3. Use modern technologies (SIMD and Vulkan)
4. The threads must be Lock-Free
5. Self updating through https://static.drips.pw/rotmg/production/current/
